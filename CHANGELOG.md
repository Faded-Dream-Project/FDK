# Changelog

FDK's public version moves only by a recorded project-owner decision
(docs/versioning.md — the rule, the enforcement, the full history
including the 2026-10-11 retraction of a premature 1.0.0). This file
is the consumer-facing summary of what each version changed; the
engineering narrative lives in docs/roadmap.md and PROGRESS.md.

The format follows Keep-a-Changelog conventions adapted to this
project: releases are chronological, each entry carries the public
API surface delta explicitly (FDK's ABI promise — docs/abi-policy.md —
makes that the contract that matters), and in-development release
candidates are marked until the owner promotes them.

## [1.1.0-rc1] — 2026-10-25 (release candidate; no tag — the owner
                 decides the final 1.1.0)

### Added — the extension API (`include/fdk/fdk_extend.h`)

The point of this release: FDK stays simple and becomes the root
other libraries and packages build on. Add-on packages can now be
written against a small, documented, stable, versioned public
surface instead of FDK's internals. Full documentation:
docs/EXTENDING.md.

- **Extension API versioning**: `FDK_EXT_API_VERSION` (compile-time)
  and `fdk_ext_api_version()` (runtime) — add-ons declare what they
  need and check what they got; additions bump the number,
  removals/renames are forbidden (same append-only discipline as the
  core ABI policy).
- **Surface kinds**: `fdk_ext_register_kind()` +
  `fdk_ext_surface_ops` (create / destroy / popup_attached) — an
  add-on registers a named kind of surface FDK knows nothing about,
  creates the native surface itself (X window, or wl_surface plus
  whatever protocol role it speaks), and hands it to FDK, which
  adopts it: event routing, the full `fdk_surface` render path
  (framebuffer, damage tracking, present, frame pacing), and popup
  parenting all work on extension surfaces.
- **Event loop integration**: `fdk_ext_loop_add_fd()` /
  `fdk_ext_loop_remove_fd()` — poll fd sources integrated into
  `fdk_pump_events()` with the timer discipline (reentrancy-safe,
  snapshot + deferred free). Timers ride the existing public
  `fdk_timer_add/remove/reset` API — one primitive, not two.
- **Documented native accessors**: `fdk_ext_get_native_display()`
  (the `Display*` / `struct wl_display *` the context is using),
  `fdk_ext_surface_native()` (the surface's `Window` XID or
  `wl_surface *`), `fdk_ext_surface_get_surface()` (the public
  `fdk_surface *` render target). No private struct is ever
  reachable.
- **Popups parented to extension surfaces**:
  `fdk_ext_popup_create()` — parent-relative positioning, input
  grab, outside-click and Escape dismissal (delivered as
  `FDK_EVENT_WINDOW_CLOSE_REQUEST`), on both backends; on Wayland the
  kind's `popup_attached` hook lets the add-on parent the xdg_popup
  to its own role object (the layer-shell `get_popup` pattern).
- **Backend + capability queries**: `fdk_ext_active_backend()`
  (Wayland or X11/XLibre) and `fdk_ext_has_capability()` (SHM
  rendering, popup grabs, EWMH dock hints, compositor frame pacing).

### Added — fdk-shell, the first add-on package (separate directory,
             own build, own version — ready to move to its own repo)

- Layer-shell-style surfaces behind one API: layers (background /
  bottom / top / overlay), edge anchors, margins, exclusive zone,
  keyboard interactivity modes, per-output selection (Wayland).
- Wayland backend: wlr-layer-shell v4 via wayland-scanner generated
  bindings (vendored protocol XML).
- X11/XLibre backend: `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK` +
  `_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL` struts — the same layering semantics the
  EWMH world offers, behind the same API.
- Desktop integration on X11 (found live on a real NVIDIA desktop):
  layers are STICKY across workspaces (`_NET_WM_DESKTOP` =
  0xFFFFFFFF + `_NET_WM_STATE_STICKY`, set as pre-map properties
  and re-asserted as root client messages after mapping — the
  Wayland behavior, arranged through EWMH); TOP/OVERLAY layers
  carry `_NET_WM_STATE_ABOVE`, OVERLAY adds SKIP_TASKBAR/SKIP_PAGER
  (the strongest EWMH stacking behavior; the fullscreen-over-docks
  protocol ceiling and what a custom WM would need to honor a true
  overlay layer are documented in fdk-shell's README); and the demo
  bar repaints on `FDK_EVENT_WINDOW_EXPOSE` — the content-loss
  contract that fixes the ghost-bar bug (a desktop round-trip left
  the bar showing whatever was underneath).
- fdk-shell's shared library links FDK's shared library (a real
  `NEEDED: libfdk.so.1` entry — the whole chain resolves through
  the loader and the distro dependency tooling), and its release
  config drops the sanitizer runtimes like FDK's does.
- Popups built on the Part-1 popup API; a demo bar (top-docked,
  one working dropdown); Xvfb strut/dock verification test and a
  prefix-isolation build test proving fdk-shell compiles against
  FDK's installed public headers and library ONLY.
- fdk-shell packages in all five distribution families
  (deb/rpm/arch/apk/xbps), each declaring a real, versioned
  dependency on the FDK runtime pinned at the extension-API floor;
  every family's install-test proves the dependency is enforced by
  the native package manager (installing fdk-shell alone is
  REFUSED), and the build itself compiles against the INSTALLED FDK
  packages — the isolation proof re-run inside every packaging
  container (fdk-shell/packaging/).

### Packaging / build

- The shared library file becomes the numeric `libfdk.so.1.1.0`
  (pre-release suffixes never appear in the .so file name — the rc
  lives in the version string, pkg-config, and package metadata);
  the SONAME symlink stays `libfdk.so.1` (the additions are
  ABI-append-only — no existing public symbol, type, or struct
  layout changed).
- New public header installed: `include/fdk/fdk_extend.h`; the
  umbrella `fdk.h` includes it.

### Fixed — the rc version vs. the five package grammars

Two distinct rc-version defects, both found live by CI on the
candidate's first pushes:

1. **Package metadata**: the raw `1.1.0-rc1` string is illegal or
   wrong in four of the five package version grammars (rpm rejects
   the hyphen outright; apk reserves it for pkgrel; arch's `pkgver`
   forbids it; xbps forbids it AND the ambiguity broke repository
   lookups; deb accepted it but ordered the rc ABOVE the future
   final). The pipeline now translates the suffix once, at the
   metadata layer (`fdk_packver` in `packaging/ci/common.sh`):
   `1.1.0~rc1` for deb/rpm, `1.1.0_rc1` for apk, `1.1.0rc1` for
   arch/xbps. Plain releases pass through unchanged.

2. **The .so file name**: the real file was installed as
   `libfdk.so.1.1.0-rc1`, and Alpine's abuild derives the apk
   `so:`provides version from the .so FILENAME tail
   (`sover=${file##*.so.}`) — producing
   `provides = so:libfdk.so.1=1.1.0-rc1`, which `apk index`
   rejects with "package file format error" (reproduced locally
   with apk-tools 2.14.12; even a hyphenless `1.1.0rc1` tail is
   rejected — only numeric tails are valid). The Makefile now names
   the real file with the numeric `FDK_SO_VERSION`
   (`libfdk.so.1.1.0`) — the GNU convention; pre-release suffixes
   never appear in the .so file name.

The dividing line in both fixes: pkg-config `Version` and the smoke
test keep the raw string the library itself reports, while the .so
file name is numeric — the file name and the version string are
different things, and each stays what its grammar requires.
Also fixed a third, independent CI flake the second push exposed:
the HiDPI GUI test's private 192-dpi Xvfb used a hard-coded `:98`
inside the `make test-x11` harness's own display range
(90 + pid%400), and on collision the test unlinked the SUITE
server's socket, its probe then reached the 96-dpi suite server
over the TCP fallback, and the scale assertion aborted the debian
job (1-in-400 per run, PID-gated). The private display now lives
below every harness range, is checked free before spawning, and is
verified OURS by its 800x600 geometry — a foreign server is never
touched (docs/testing.md's 1.1.0-rc1 lesson).
Documented in `docs/packaging.md`. Also corrected three stale "ten
shipped theme faces" package descriptions the one-face alignment
had missed (deb control, rpm spec, xbps descriptions now say the
default theme, faded-dream).

### Fixed — the GPU present lane's self-check verdicts (found live
                on an NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti desktop)

The lane's first-frame self-verification had three defects, all
visible as repeated warnings on a real desktop (every dropdown
click re-logged the whole failure sequence, once per new popup
window):

1. **Not-viewable reads were treated as GPU failures.** A popup
   whose first present raced its own map got `XGetImage` →
   BadMatch — a property of the WINDOW STATE, not the driver. The
   check now gates on viewability first (`map_state ==
   IsViewable`, the programmatic MapNotify/Expose equivalent) and
   clamps its probe region into the server-reported window bounds;
   a not-viewable or unreadable window is INCONCLUSIVE and retried
   at the next completed present, never a downgrade.
2. **Present-latency timing was treated as a driver limitation.**
   The first read after `glXSwapBuffers` can still show the
   window's pre-frame background (DRI3/Present schedules the flip
   at vblank; compositing WMs re-composite on their own clock) —
   the live report's "server (000000) vs CPU (color)" mismatch was
   exactly the bar window's BlackPixel background. A bounded retry
   budget (~3 vblanks) now separates the timing case (a retry
   matches: PASS, logged once at INFO) from the real limitation
   (every retry mismatches: FAIL).
3. **The verdict was per-window.** Each new popup re-engaged the
   lane, re-probed, re-failed, and re-logged — the repeated
   warnings, and the XID churn (window + GLX context + GC + two
   SHM segments per click). The verdict is now decided once per
   connection (the driver-wide truth): PASS and later windows skip
   the probe entirely; a REAL failure refuses the lane for the
   whole process (the same env-knob-keyed policy cache the
   renderer verdict uses) and logs exactly one warning.
   `FDK_GL_SELFCHECK_POISON=1` is the new test seam (the
   FDK_GL_FAIL_AT shape) and `fdk__x11_gl_test_reset()` clears the
   stamp between test groups.

### Fixed — the fdk-shell packaging matrix's first live CI pass

Four defect classes, all packaging-script defects (none in library
code), all invisible to the sandbox battery — three because the
sandbox cannot run the native packagers (no rpmbuild/abuild/
xbps-create/pacman, uid 1001, no docker), one because the local
deb verification extracts packages instead of installing them:

1. **The deb/rpm install-test smoke needed X11 dev headers as TEST
   INFRASTRUCTURE** (it reads server-side truth through a second
   Xlib connection; the .pc chain deliberately carries no `x11`
   Requires). The clean install containers now pre-install
   `libx11-dev` / `libX11-devel` — the same class as their
   gcc/pkg-config/xvfb, and what the alpine/void/arch families
   already declared. CI's own logs proved the fix sufficient: the
   identical smoke passed inside the deb build container, where the
   headers existed.
2. **FDK's own rpm install-test selected `dist/*.rpm`**, sweeping
   the add-on's packages into a test whose removal step then got
   (correctly) refused — a working dependency blocking removal of
   its base. It now selects FDK's own rpms by name; arch's
   equivalent `head -1` sort-order landmine is now a deterministic
   `fdk-[0-9]*` glob.
3. **The fdk-shell apk build hand-fed a bare sha512 into the
   APKBUILD** — abuild's checksum array must carry the FILENAME
   (`abuild checksum` writes the correct form; FDK's own apk
   pipeline already used exactly that sequence). The rewrite also
   fixed the artifact collection (abuild writes to REPODEST, not
   the build dir) and dropped the `abuild -r -F` cargo cult.
4. **The fdk-shell xbps build checked `dist/` while xbps-create
   wrote into the current directory** — both packages had built
   successfully; the collection line FDK's own void build carries
   (`mv ./*.xbps dist/`) was missing.

5. **The generated fdk-shell.pc carried the library's platform link
   deps in Libs** (`pkg-config --libs x11 wayland-client` appended —
   every consumer forced to install the X11 AND Wayland dev
   packages; the clean-container smokes died at
   `ld: cannot find -lwayland-client`; build-machine -L paths baked
   into the artifact) **and never defined its own variables**
   (`${libdir}`/`${includedir}` undefined — empty expansion that
   only worked because /usr/include and the default linker path
   need no flags). The .pc now matches fdk.pc's contract: variables
   defined, `Libs: -lfdk-shell` + `Requires: fdk`, platform flags
   in `Libs.private`. The smoke's own second Xlib connection now
   carries `-lX11` on its link line (modern ld refuses to resolve a
   binary's own symbols through a shared library's transitive
   NEEDED — "DSO missing from command line"), and pkg-config
   discovery failures print the real diagnostic instead of
   swallowing it.

The same run closed void: the corrected .pc made the build-phase
smoke discover and link the installed fdk-shell (the old
"cannot find" never recurred to fire its new diagnostic), and the
remaining void failure was the install-test's missing runtime
shlibs — xbps resolves a package's declared shlib-requires only
against INSTALLED providers, so the combined-set transaction
aborted on fdk-devel's libXext.so.6/libxkbcommon.so.0; the
install-test now pre-installs the same runtime shlibs FDK's own
void install-test carries.

Also: the fdk-shell distro build scripts restored the explaining
comment for FDK's `LSAN_OPTIONS=exitcode=0` distro-container leak
policy (the copy had dropped it), the inert copies of that flag
where the sanitizer toolchain is off (alpine/void, musl/minimal)
were removed, and the el10-leg Xvfb gating in the rpm/alpine/void
install-tests now follows the helper's disclosed-skip contract
(`if fdk_start_xvfb; then … else disclose`) instead of hard-failing
on images with no Xorg server.

### Unreleased-candidate notes

- No git tag, no GitHub release for rc1 (owner's instruction). The
  v1.0.0 release and its tag are untouched. CI still builds and
  install-tests all five package families on every push to main —
  that is pipeline validation, not a release, and it is exactly how
  the rc-version defect above was caught.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-10-12 (re-cut same day as the one-face alignment)

The first public release. The versioned-SONAME scheme activated with
it (`libfdk.so.1`). Highlights of the surface as shipped:

- Dual-backend core (Wayland via xdg-shell; X11/XLibre), software
  renderer (exact + antialiased rasterizer, damage-tracked
  presentation, MIT-SHM / wl_shm transport, optional GLX present
  lane), retained widget tree + box layout + text (stb_truetype) +
  theming (the built-in default plus `.fdk` face files), clipboard
  (text + PNG images, PRIMARY selection), drag and drop, dialogs,
  i18n, a11y narration, undo, prefs, animation, the fdk-theme /
  fdk-prefs / fdk-set CLI tools.
- Ships exactly ONE theme — `faded-dream`, the packaged copy of the
  built-in default/fallback. The next faces are `.FDKThemes`
  drop-ins users install (`~/.FDKThemes` / system data dirs), never
  package content; the Makefile's `SHIPPED_THEMES` is pinned to the
  single file so a stray face cannot ride into a release.
- Five package families built and install-tested in CI (deb, rpm,
  pacman, apk, xbps), source archive + SHA256SUMS, all published on
  the main repository's v1.0.0 release.
